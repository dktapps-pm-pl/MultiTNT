# MultiTNT

Ignite all TNT connected to the target one when lighting TNT

## How does it work?
When you use flint and steel on TNT, the plugin scans all the sides of the block (up, down, left, right, forward, back).
If a TNT block is found, it's ignited and the process is repeated with that block.

## I killed my server!
Be more careful. This plugin can cause a server to run out of memory if it's misused too heavily.
